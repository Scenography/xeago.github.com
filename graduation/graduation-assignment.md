[VideofyMe] is a videohosting platform targeted at blogs and social websites. They work with thousands of blogs and websites who want a free and easy to use but high quality solution for their video needs. They believe that making a video and putting it on your blog should be as easy as it is rewarding. They provide widgets, plugins, integration with blogging tools and a JavaScript-SDK for the super-user.  
During my internship at VideofyMe I shall adress a common user request: search. The current search system is inadequate as it does not fullfill the users' desires, does not find items reliably and is as hard to extend as it is slow. I will develop, and implement, search in a distributed manner. I will design and deploy a distributed architecture for future extensibility and scalability. The search index will not be open to the public, so as to not forget about security and search scraping. Accessing the index will happen through the internal API of VideofyMe.  
The current implementation uses generated SQL and an ORM within a MVC architecture. I will adhere to the MVC-architecture while designing, and developing, an all new implementation. 
This assignment forms the basis for my finals.
