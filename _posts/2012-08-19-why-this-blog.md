title: Why this blog?
---

A few posts ago, I mentioned my reasoning for this blog. However I feel it is incomplete. Let me tell you why.

## Speed
I've lost a lot of my speed while typing during my studies in favor of making less typos. However, during my graduation internship, I will have to write tons of documents and therefore I want to increase my speed, and overall efficiency in typing. I feel this can be done by writing more documents in general.

## Position
As a programmer I type pretty much all day. Unfortunately, I do not sit properly all day, I mostly just hang around. I was amazed by Jesper, he has a 100% straight back, all the time. As I already have back-pains, my position has to change. Whenever I write on my blog I pay extra attention to my posture and make it a habit to sit like that.

## Skill
I've also noticed over the last few weeks that my vocabulary, while broad, still limits the expression of my thoughts. There were occasions I used german to figure out what exactly I meant, and my german is horrific to say the least. My Dutch is stuttering as well, nearly all my communication is in English. Because English is now my main language I need to become more fluent in typing.

## Publishing standards
My quality control in documentation is low. I have to get in the habit of checking for typos, verifying sources. I have a habit of making long uncontrolled sentences so I have to check for sentence structure and for fluent paragraphs. I feel good about setting high requirements on my standards. Again, writing more documents will help me establish a habit for this.

## Penmanship
Seriously, did you think I care about my handwriting? :)
