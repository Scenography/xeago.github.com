title: The first days at VideofyMe
---

My first day of internship was the first day after holidays for VideofyMe as well. For that reason there was a breakfast combined with status updates. Breakfast got served by Robert and Anna-Sara. Lovely fresh bread with cheese, ham and tomatoes! :D

After breakfast I got invited onto our private GitHub, and cloned the repos I was most likely to be working on. Meanwhile Patrick created an account at google-apps for me and Jesper invited me to Campfire and Basecamp. In less than an hour I had TextMate open and was browsing their code.

There's a coming deadline for the launch of the new website layout, but it's not noticeable amongst my friendly colleagues.

The working environment is relaxed. There's flex-working-hours and while I like them, time will tell if they work for me. The following days continued just as relaxed. I usually start between 9:30-10:00 and leave around 18:00-18:30.
