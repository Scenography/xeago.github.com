title: Keeping in touch
---

Every time I go away from home, lengthy or not, I get the same requests and complaints over and over again. Apparently I am really bad at keeping in touch. Well, I figured, nothing is helping me&hellip;

**Until now!**

Henceforth, I have created this blog to help myself stay in touch with my relatives, friends and other random people.

I had to get rid of some feature creep and postpone that for the near future. Please come back later for more content and interface updates.

For the interested, the blog is built with [Jekyll], using the [Minimal] template.
