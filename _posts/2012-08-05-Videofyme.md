It is the fifth of august 2012. Quite nervous at the time of writing because as-of tomorrow I will be an intern at [Videofyme].

As usual, interns get assigned a mentor and I am quite happy with my assigned menter: Rianne. It was said she'd have time during the summer vacation. First thing I will have to address with her is that I was unable to enroll in STAGE. This because an examiner fell short to communicate the achievement of 2 courses, worth 12 ECTS together which disallows me to enroll.

I've had good contact with Patrick, the CTO from [Videofyme], see their [about] page for contact details and other information. He is (re-)implementing fast distributed search, I will continue his work. I don't want go more in detail without authorization. Tomorrow there will be a long breakfast / warmup at [tullhus 3][tullhus], the venture where Videofyme is located. I have no idea what to expect and because I prefer to be really lazy and slow in the morning, I am neglecting, ahead of time, to make breakfast! I hope they have some yummies :D.

Next week, on tuesday, there'll be a kickoff where we'll the office at 3 pm and get back the next day.
