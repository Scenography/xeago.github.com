Ever since I heard about internship, I knew I wanted to do my internship in some other country. During the study programme there are in total two internships, each having a length of 800 hours. Initially I aimed high, USA. I however started too late. Eventually I saw a flyer of QNH coming by, and went with that. They had a nice assignment but the mentoring was far to be sought. My search for an internship abroad continued.

I started applying to the big companies; think of Google, Apple and the likes. But by accident I saw a 'Jobs' link while watching stuff on [twitch.tv]. They used [Jobvite] for processing applications. Seeing these two services, I got blown away by the discovery I made: **I want to work for a service**.

Once I realized this, I studied Jobvite a bit to find out how their services works, nifty and really simple. I then applied to JustinTV, the company that has twitch.tv as a subdivision for e-sports. Within a day I got a reply from Brooke asking me to do one of the challenges that are found on [their website]. I choose the [prefixer problem] and completed it in about 12 hours of time. While the [prefixer challenge] did not request information about the time complexity of the program, I provided it anyways as the other challenge did in fact request it. In their code-review they said they liked my approach and extensive documentation and analysis.

After the review, I had a Skype conversation with Zach, the sound quality was horrible. He asked me to code the blablabla challenge. I had difficulties understanding him but when I got linked to a textual description everything was fine. We then proceeded to talk about threading and atomicity. I had a good talk with Zach, but I wasn't the only one aiming to be an intern. They decided that we should face-up against each other in Starcraft 2 and broadcast it live. Unfortunately I did not win.

After recouping from my loss, I applied to other companies that provide a service: [Box], [Jobvite], [Dropbox], [Movable Ink], [Recurly], [GitHub], [Scribd] and [VideofyMe] to name a few. While most of them responded only a few were in a position they could take interns from over the sea. It apparently costs an awful lot to them to have me as an intern. One, however, wasn't located in the USA, but in Stockholm, Sweden. I found them by chance when trying to find available positions at [GitHub]. Apparently [GitHub Jobs] automatically searches close to you, if it can find a location using Geo-IP. I started my search in Holland but I had to refresh when I got connectivity in sweden. This is how I found VideofyMe.
I sent them my application and resume and was requested to come to their office the following morning. I had a great talk with [Patrick] and they asked me to do a coding challenge. Their challenge was to resize images in the background. I immediately thought of resque, and after a quick verification that eased the challenge a bit. This was my first project in ruby, I liked it.
I visited a few times after that and had a talk with the Robert, the CEO, as well.

Following my visits to VideofyMe, I had to get the approval of my internship. I showed Waddy a [broad description] of VideofyMe and got his approval.
